# HiveHub documentation

> **Project renamed: HiveScale → HiveHub.** What began as a dual beehive scale
> has grown into a general **data collector / hub for many types of beehive
> sensors and scales** (up to 16 hives per ESP32), so the project was renamed.
> A few internal identifiers (the database measurement columns, the OTA `target`
> value, the Docker image name, the device's stored-config namespace, MQTT
> topics) still use the old `hivescale` name on purpose — changing them would
> need data/firmware migrations — and the third-party **beehivemonitoring.com
> "HiveScale"** wireless weight scale is an unrelated product that keeps its own
> name.

Reference docs for **HiveHub**, an ESP32-based data collector for beehive
sensors and scales. HiveHub reads a range of sensors natively on the device —
a selectable **ambient sensor** (SHT4x/SHT40, SHT3x, or a BME280 that also
reports barometric pressure), **DS18B20** (in-hive
temperature), **INMP441** (in-hive sound),
**MAX17048** (LiPo battery), and **wired load cells via NAU7802 or HX711** — and
bridges wireless BLE/GATT sensors and scales on top. For the project overview,
hardware list, firmware/server setup, and API summary, start with the
[main README](../README.md). The pages below go deeper on individual topics.

## Hardware & wiring

- [multi-hive.md](multi-hive.md) — **up to 16 hives per ESP32** (firmware v0.20.0): NAU7802 I2C scales, TCA9548A mux, one DS18B20 per hive, the hive-centric portal, the BLE budget, and the data model.
- [wiring.md](wiring.md) — full ESP32 pin map and wiring for every sensor and module.
- [../pcb-design/README.md](../pcb-design/README.md) — the KiCad boards (all tested and working): **ESP32-C6 Scale Module (recommended)**, NAU7802 breakout, Power Module, and the legacy 30-pin Scale Module — pinouts and fabrication notes.
- [accelerometer.md](accelerometer.md) — the vibration science and ~20 Hz pre-swarm signal (read over BLE from an in-hive sensor; the old wired LIS3DH/LIS2DH12 driver has been removed).

## In-hive BLE sensors & bee counters

- [hiveinside-ble-sensor.md](hiveinside-ble-sensor.md) — HiveInside in-hive node (on-board FFT bands): the nRF54LM20A beacon, pairing, and OTA.
- [audio-recording.md](audio-recording.md) — **listen to a hive**: ask a HiveInside for 10–60 seconds of audio, relayed over BLE and played back in the dashboard. The shared key both sides need, the quality flags, and why it is not live listening.
- [holyiot-ble-sensor.md](holyiot-ble-sensor.md) — HolyIot 25015 beacon (temp / humidity / pressure / acceleration) and pairing.
- [ruuvitag-ble-sensor.md](ruuvitag-ble-sensor.md) — RuuviTag four-in-one beacon on the same scan bridge.
- [beehivemonitoring-gatt.md](beehivemonitoring-gatt.md) — beehivemonitoring.com HiveHeart (in-hive) and HiveScale (weight) over GATT, why only one reader can connect at a time, and how to debug `connect failed` / `status=13`.
- [hivetraffic-bee-counter.md](hivetraffic-bee-counter.md) — HiveTraffic wireless entrance bee counter (BLE/GATT).
- [device-not-supported-yet.md](device-not-supported-yet.md) — **my device isn't in the list yet**: how to request support as a GitHub issue and capture the integration data with nRF Connect.

## Firmware behaviour

- [offgrid-firmware-notes.md](offgrid-firmware-notes.md) — LiPo (MAX17048) power telemetry and the wake/deep-sleep cycle.
- [calibration-mode.md](calibration-mode.md) — fast-cycle calibration mode (firmware + backend).
- [inspection-mode.md](inspection-mode.md) — **inspection mode**: the external button, the API, and how a window with the hive open is kept out of the charts, insights and alerts without deleting anything.
- [ap-mode-sd-download.md](ap-mode-sd-download.md) — AP/setup mode, the setup button, and the SD-card download + HivePal re-import.

## Backend, API & insights

- [../server/dashboard/README.md](../server/dashboard/README.md) — the optional **built-in web dashboard** (login-protected `/api/v1/local/*` API served at `/dashboard`) for single-owner self-hosts; [try the live demo](https://macnite.github.io/HiveHub/dashboard-demo/).
- [api.md](api.md) — complete REST API reference (device + HivePal app endpoints, payload, schema).
- [publish-embed.md](publish-embed.md) — **publish a chart publicly** and embed it in a website (`<iframe>`, JSON or CSV), while everything else stays behind the dashboard login.
- [mqtt.md](mqtt.md) — optional **MQTT bridge** to Home Assistant / Node-RED / openHAB: topics, config, and per-hive / per-module Home Assistant auto-discovery.
- [temperature-compensation.md](temperature-compensation.md) — backend load-cell temperature-drift correction and the fit endpoint.
- [insights.md](insights.md) — rule-based colony insight detector catalogue.
- [insights-sources-tldr.md](insights-sources-tldr.md) — TL;DR of the research literature behind the insights.
- [notifications.md](notifications.md) — insight alert notifications by e-mail (SMTP) and Web Push (browser / PWA).

## Deployment & testing

- [backup-restore.md](backup-restore.md) — **download / back up every reading** from the dashboard and load it back after a redeploy, or hand it to a beekeeper moving to their own server.
- [docker-install.md](docker-install.md) — generic Docker / Docker Compose deployment.
- [truenas-install.md](truenas-install.md) — TrueNAS Scale (Custom App) deployment.
- [test-commands.md](test-commands.md) — `curl` examples for exercising the backend.
