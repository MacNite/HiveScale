# HiveScale off-grid power telemetry

Off-grid builds add **power telemetry** to the normal HiveScale measurement
cycle: solar/load monitoring with an INA219 and LiPo fuel-gauge monitoring with a
MAX17048. Both are optional I2C modules and are disabled by default. Enable them
per device in `firmware/include/secrets.h`.

> **Connectivity has moved.** Earlier firmware supported a SIM7080G LTE/NB-IoT
> modem for cellular transport. That has been removed — the ESP32 firmware is now
> **Wi-Fi only**. LTE/NB-IoT, solar charging, and battery management are handled
> by a separate **Power Module** that connects to the Scale Module over
> I2C/ESP-NOW. The backend still accepts `network_transport`, `cellular_ok`, and
> `cellular_csq` so that Power Module can report cellular status later; on-device
> firmware reports `network_transport: "wifi"`.

## Feature flags

Use numeric `0` / `1` values because the firmware uses preprocessor `#if` checks.

```cpp
#define ENABLE_INA219_SOLAR      1
#define ENABLE_MAX17048_BATTERY  1
```

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_INA219_SOLAR` | `0` | Compiles in INA219 support and adds solar/load telemetry fields |
| `ENABLE_MAX17048_BATTERY` | `0` | Compiles in MAX17048 support and adds LiPo telemetry fields |

When you enable a flag, also uncomment the matching library in
`firmware/platformio.ini`:

- `adafruit/Adafruit INA219` for `ENABLE_INA219_SOLAR`
- `sparkfun/SparkFun MAX1704x Fuel Gauge Arduino Library` for `ENABLE_MAX17048_BATTERY`

## Solar telemetry with INA219

Enable:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_INA219_SOLAR 1
#define INA219_I2C_ADDRESS  0x40
```

Wiring uses the shared I2C bus:

| INA219 pin | ESP32 pin |
|---|---|
| VCC | 3.3 V |
| GND | GND |
| SDA | GPIO21 |
| SCL | GPIO22 |

Measurement fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `solar_monitor_ok` | INA219 detected and readable |
| `solar_bus_voltage_v` | Bus voltage in volts |
| `solar_shunt_voltage_mv` | Shunt voltage in millivolts |
| `solar_load_voltage_v` | Calculated bus + shunt voltage |
| `solar_current_ma` | Current in milliamps |
| `solar_power_mw` | Power in milliwatts |

## LiPo telemetry with MAX17048

Enable:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_MAX17048_BATTERY 1
#define MAX17048_ALERT_PERCENT  20
```

Wiring uses the shared I2C bus plus the battery sense connection required by the breakout board.

Measurement fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `battery_monitor_ok` | MAX17048 detected and readable |
| `battery_voltage_v` | Battery voltage in volts |
| `battery_soc_percent` | Battery state-of-charge percentage |
| `battery_alert` | Alert flag from the fuel gauge |

The backend also returns `battery_voltage` for backwards compatibility, mapped from `battery_voltage_v` when available.

## Backend storage and API behavior

The backend stores power telemetry in dedicated columns as well as in `raw_json`.

The startup schema and `server/migrations/001_offgrid_telemetry.sql` include columns for:

- battery state-of-charge, voltage, monitor status, and alert
- solar voltage/current/power values
- transport and cellular status (reserved for the Power Module)
- calibration mode state
- boot count
- time source

These fields are returned by `/api/v1/measurements/latest` and the HivePal app measurement endpoints.

## Power-saving behavior

Normal operation is one wake cycle:

1. Wake from deep sleep or reset.
2. Power up sensors and HX711 modules.
3. Measure weights, temperatures, acoustic levels, and optional power telemetry.
4. Connect over Wi-Fi.
5. Upload the measurement and retry cached rows.
6. Poll config and commands.
7. Power down HX711 and SD where supported.
8. Enter deep sleep until the next send interval.

The INA219 and MAX17048 sit on the shared I2C bus and are read in step 3 when their flags are enabled.

## Practical notes

- Add bulk capacitance close to any LiPo/solar input; load peaks can brown out weak supplies.
- Keep load-cell analog wiring away from switching regulators.
- Set the MAX17048 low-battery alert (`MAX17048_ALERT_PERCENT`) to match your battery and duty cycle.
- Use the SD card cache as protection against temporary Wi-Fi outages, not as a replacement for regular connectivity checks.
- For cellular/solar charging in the field, use the separate Power Module rather than wiring a modem directly to the Scale Module.
