# HiveHub API reference

The HiveHub backend exposes a FastAPI REST API and Swagger UI at `http://<host>:31115/docs`.

---

## Base URL

```text
http://<host>:31115
```

Replace `<host>` with the server IP address or domain name.

> **TLS:** the ESP32 firmware now verifies the backend's TLS certificate (it
> ships the ISRG Root X1 / Let's Encrypt root CA in `firmware/include/ca_cert.h`
> and syncs time over NTP for validity checks). Production devices must reach
> the API over **HTTPS with a valid certificate** — put the API behind a reverse
> proxy that terminates TLS. Plain-HTTP examples below are for host-side `curl`
> testing only.

---

## Authentication

HiveHub uses separate credentials for device traffic and HivePal app traffic.

### Device key

ESP32 firmware and administrative device tooling use `X-API-Key`.

```text
X-API-Key: your-api-key
```

There are two kinds of device key:

- **Per-device key** — each device has its own unique key (set as `API_KEY` in
  that device's `secrets.h`). On the first request from a new `device_id`, the
  backend stores a hash of the presented key and binds it to that device.
  Every later request for that device must present the same key, so a leaked
  key only affects the one device it belongs to. Used by the device-initiated
  endpoints: `POST /api/v1/measurements`, `GET/PATCH …/config`,
  `GET …/firmware`, `GET …/commands/next`, and `POST …/commands/{id}/result`.
- **Master/admin key** — the value of the server `API_KEY` environment
  variable. Used for server-to-server / tooling endpoints that no device
  calls: `GET /api/v1/measurements/latest`, `POST /api/v1/firmware/releases`,
  `POST …/commands` (queueing), `…/commands/update-hiveinside`, and
  `GET /api/v1/time`.

> A device's per-device key no longer has to match the server `API_KEY`. To
> rotate or re-register a device key, clear its stored hash with
> `UPDATE devices SET api_key_hash = NULL WHERE device_id = '…';` and the next
> request re-registers whatever key the device presents.

### HivePal service key + user token

HivePal uses `X-HivePal-Service-Key` plus a per-user JWT on all app endpoints.

```text
X-HivePal-Service-Key: your-hivepal-service-key
Authorization: Bearer <hivepal-jwt>
```

The service key must match HiveHub's `HIVEPAL_SERVICE_API_KEY`. The JWT is the
access token HivePal issues to its own users; HiveHub verifies its signature
with the shared `HIVEPAL_JWT_SECRET` (HS256) and reads the user ID from the
token's `sub` claim to enforce per-device ownership and roles. The legacy
plaintext `X-User-Id` header is no longer accepted.

---

## General endpoints

### `GET /health`

Health check. No authentication required. `version` is the backend server
version (`SERVER_VERSION` in `server/config.py`).

```json
{ "status": "ok", "version": "0.4.1" }
```

### `GET /api/v1/time`

Returns current UTC server time for RTC sync.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (master/admin key)

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "unix": 1777636800,
  "timezone": "UTC"
}
```

---

## Measurements

### `POST /api/v1/measurements`

Submit a measurement from a device. On the first measurement from a new `device_id`, the backend creates a device record and a default config row, and registers the presented `X-API-Key` as that device's per-device key. If a `claim_code` is included, it is hashed and stored so a HivePal user can claim the device.

Current firmware includes an immutable `measurement_id` in every measurement.
The backend uses `(device_id, measurement_id)` as an idempotency key: replaying
the exact same cached JSON returns success with `duplicate: true` rather than
creating a second row or re-publishing a retained MQTT state. Older clients
without this field remain supported but cannot get this delivery guarantee.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (per-device key — registered on first contact, enforced thereafter)

> **Multi-hive payload (firmware v0.20.0+).** Devices now report up to 16 hives in
> a `hives` array (see below); the flat `scale_1/2_*` / `hive_1/2_*` fields are the
> legacy two-hive form and remain accepted. The server stores per-hive data in the
> `hive_readings` table, mirrors hives 1–2 onto the legacy columns, and on read
> returns **both** a `hives` array and synthesized `scale_N_*`/`hive_N_*` flat keys
> for every hive. See [multi-hive.md](multi-hive.md).

| `hive_count` | int | No | Number of hives the device has configured |
| `claim_code` | string | No | Pairing code; the firmware keeps sending it until the server confirms the device is claimed (via the `claimed` field in the response below), after which it is omitted to limit exposure. This means a rebuilt/restored backend automatically re-learns the code and the device stays claimable. |
| `timestamp` | ISO datetime | No | Measurement time; server receive time is used if omitted |
| `scale_1_weight_kg` | number | No | Scale 1 weight in kilograms |

| `inspection` | boolean | No | The hub believes a beekeeper has the hive open. The hive readings in the same payload are still stored; the flag opens/closes a window that keeps them out of charts, insights and alerts. See [inspection-mode.md](inspection-mode.md) |
| `inspection_started_at` | int | No | Unix seconds at which the hub started the inspection, so the window is back-dated to the button press rather than to the first upload reporting it |
| `boot_count` | integer | No | ESP32 RTC boot counter |
| `time_source` | string | No | Time source such as `rtc`, `server`, `cellular`, or `compile` |
| `rssi_dbm` | integer | No | Wi-Fi RSSI or CSQ-derived approximate RSSI |

| `rtc_ok` | boolean | No | RTC status |
| `sht_ok` | boolean | No | Whether the current cycle produced a valid ambient measurement (SHT4x/SHT3x/BME280; false when `ambient_temp_c`/`ambient_humidity_percent` are null because the read failed). Field name kept `sht_*` for backward compatibility |

| `mic_{left,right}_band_high_dbfs` | number | No | 1500–3000 Hz band energy |

#### Entrance-counter fields (HiveTraffic BeeCounter — BLE/GATT only)

One HiveTraffic counter may be paired per hive; it is read over **BLE/GATT**
(the only supported bee-counter transport — the wired I2C path was removed).
Each block is independent; a paired-but-unreachable unit reports
`bee_counter_N_ok=false` and the rest of its fields null; an unpaired hive
sends no bee-counter fields at all. Current firmware reports **lifetime totals
only** — the interval columns are backfilled server-side by differencing
consecutive totals. For `N` in `1`, `2`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `bee_counter_N_ok` | boolean | Counter reached and parsed this cycle |
| `bee_counter_N_protocol_version` | integer | Counter **wire-format** revision (BLE `fw` field) — not its firmware version, which is `hives[].bee_counter.version` |
| `bee_counter_N_status_flags` | integer | Status bitfield |
| `bee_counter_N_uptime_s` | integer | Counter uptime in seconds. 32-bit as of wire revision 3; a `fw:2` counter clamps it at 65535 (18 h 12 min) |
| `bee_counter_N_num_gates` | integer | Gates wired to the counter (24) |
| `bee_counter_N_gates_healthy` | integer | **Legacy, wired-era only.** Despite the name this counted MCP23017 port expanders, 0..3 — never gates. BLE counters do not write this column; see below |
| `bee_counter_N_total_in` / `_total_out` | integer | Cumulative (lifetime) in/out counts, saturating at 4294967295 |
| `bee_counter_N_glitch_count` | integer | Diagnostics. 32-bit and saturating as of wire revision 3; a `fw:2` counter pins at 65535 |

BLE counters report their expander health as `hives[].bee_counter.mcps_healthy`
(0..3, **not** a count of working gates — each healthy expander covers eight of
the 24). It was called `gates_healthy` before HiveTraffic wire revision 3, and
readings stored before that change carry the old key in
`hive_readings.raw_json` with the same meaning. The value is live health: it
moves during a deployment as expanders fail and recover, so nothing may treat it
as constant after boot.

`bee_counter_N_interval_in` / `_interval_out` are also accepted and are fully
live — the BLE path leaves them null on ingest and the read APIs backfill them
by differencing consecutive totals.

The wired-only telemetry — `_busy_retries`, `_read_attempts`,
`_latch_succeeded`, and the per-gate 24-byte arrays
(`bee_counter_N_per_gate_in` / `_per_gate_out`) — is **no longer accepted**. It
described the I2C transport (bus retries, whether `CMD_LATCH` landed), which no
firmware speaks anymore; a payload carrying these fields has them ignored rather
than stored. The `measurements` columns are deliberately kept and the read APIs
still return them, so readings recorded during the wired era stay retrievable.
Every row written since is null there.

#### Vibration fields (in-hive accelerometer)

Per-hive vibration, populated from a paired in-hive **BLE sensor** (a HiveInside
nRF54LM20A supplies the full FFT bands; a HolyIot 25015 / RuuviTag beacon supplies
only broadband `accel_N_rms_mg` / `accel_N_peak_mg`) — see
[accelerometer.md](accelerometer.md). (The old wired LIS3DH/LIS2DH12 driver has
been removed; vibration is BLE-only.) Each block is independent; a missing
source reports `accel_N_ok=false` and the rest of its fields are null. All
band/RMS values are AC (gravity removed), in milli-g (mg). For `N` in `1`, `2`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `accel_N_ok` | boolean | Vibration source present and read this cycle |
| `accel_N_sample_rate_hz` | integer | Output data rate used for the capture |
| `accel_N_sample_count` | integer | Samples fed into the FFT |
| `accel_N_range_g` | integer | Full-scale range (±2/4/8/16 g) |
| `accel_N_rms_mg` | number | Broadband AC RMS of the vector magnitude |
| `accel_N_peak_mg` | number | Peak deviation from the mean |
| `accel_N_band_swarm_mg` | number | 8–30 Hz energy — ~20 Hz pre-swarm signal (consumed by Insights) |
| `accel_N_band_fanning_mg` | number | 30–100 Hz fanning/ventilation energy |
| `accel_N_band_activity_mg` | number | 100–200 Hz general activity energy |

See [accelerometer.md](accelerometer.md) for the rationale and wiring.

The full payload is also stored as JSONB in `raw_json`. The request model uses
`extra="ignore"`, so **only fields declared on `MeasurementIn` are stored** —
any field the model does not know about is silently dropped, not preserved in
`raw_json`. When adding a new telemetry field (e.g. a new GATT field), declare
it on `MeasurementIn` or it will be discarded on ingest.

> `network_transport` is accepted and stored for the future Power Module. The
> current ESP32 firmware is Wi-Fi only and reports `network_transport: "wifi"`.
> The old `cellular_ok` / `cellular_csq` fields were **removed from the schema**
> and are silently ignored if sent (`extra="ignore"`).

#### Example Wi-Fi payload

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "claim_code": "ABCD-1234",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-01T12:00:00Z",
  "scale_1_weight_kg": 42.5,
  "scale_2_weight_kg": 38.2,
  "hive_1_temp_c": 34.1,
  "hive_2_temp_c": 33.7,
  "ambient_temp_c": 18.4,
  "ambient_humidity_percent": 61.2,
  "network_transport": "wifi",
  "rssi_dbm": -65,
  "firmware_version": "0.9.2",
  "config_version": 3,
  "sd_ok": true,
  "rtc_ok": true,
  "sht_ok": true,
  "scale_1_raw": -298450,
  "scale_2_raw": -271900
}
```

#### Example off-grid payload

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_offgrid_01",
  "claim_code": "ABCD-1234",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-01T12:00:00Z",
  "scale_1_weight_kg": 42.5,
  "scale_2_weight_kg": 38.2,
  "network_transport": "sim7080g",
  "rssi_dbm": -77,
  "battery_voltage_v": 3.94,
  "battery_soc_percent": 73.2,
  "battery_alert": false,
  "battery_monitor_ok": true,
  "solar_monitor_ok": true,
  "solar_bus_voltage_v": 5.22,
  "solar_shunt_voltage_mv": 12.4,
  "solar_load_voltage_v": 5.232,
  "solar_current_ma": 184.0,
  "solar_power_mw": 960.0,
  "calibration_mode": false,
  "boot_count": 128,
  "time_source": "cellular"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "id": 1042,
  "measured_at": "2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "claimed": false
}
```

`claimed` is `true` once a HivePal user has claimed the device. The firmware keeps
sending its `claim_code` until it sees `claimed: true`, so that a backend that has
lost the device record (fresh install, DB restore) re-learns the claim code and the
device can be claimed again without a re-flash.

### `GET /api/v1/measurements/latest`

Returns recent measurements across all devices, newest-first.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (master/admin key)

| Query parameter | Default | Max | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `limit` | 50 | 500 | Number of rows to return |

The response includes the core fields and the optional off-grid fields listed above.

## Device configuration

### `GET /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/config`

Returns the current config for a device. A default config is created if none exists.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (per-device key)

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "send_interval_seconds": 600,
  "scale1_offset": 0,
  "scale1_factor": -7050.0,
  "scale2_offset": 0,
  "scale2_factor": -7050.0,
  "config_version": 3,
  "tempco_enabled": false,
  "tempco_source": "ambient",
  "tempco_ref_temp_c": 20.0,
  "scale1_tempco_kg_per_c": 0.0,
  "scale2_tempco_kg_per_c": 0.0,
  "beecounter_night_mode_enabled": false,
  "beecounter_night_start_minute": 1200,
  "beecounter_night_end_minute": 360,
  "beecounter_night_max_traffic": 0,
  "timezone": "",
  "beecounter_bank1_enabled": true,
  "beecounter_bank2_enabled": true,
  "beecounter_bank3_enabled": true,
  "inspection_timeout_minutes": 60
}
```

`inspection_timeout_minutes` (1–1440, default 60) caps how long an inspection
may run before the device ends it by itself — see
[inspection-mode.md](inspection-mode.md#auto-end). Applied on every config fetch
and persisted in NVS, so a hub that boots without WiFi still ends its
inspections. It is a safety net, not a schedule: without it one forgotten button
press blanks a hive's charts indefinitely, which looks exactly like a dead
sensor.

The `beecounter_night_*` fields configure **HiveTraffic night mode** — see
[hivetraffic-bee-counter.md](hivetraffic-bee-counter.md#night-mode). Unlike the
calibration fields below, the device applies them on **every** config fetch
rather than only when `config_version` changes: there is no portal-side
counterpart to protect, and turning the window off has to take effect on the
next cycle rather than waiting for an unrelated edit to bump the version.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `beecounter_night_mode_enabled` | Master switch. `false` by default, so an existing device is unaffected until it is turned on. |
| `beecounter_night_start_minute` / `beecounter_night_end_minute` | The window, in **local** minutes since midnight (0–1439). `start > end` wraps midnight, which the 20:00–06:00 default does. `start == end` is an **empty** window, not a 24-hour one — the firmware refuses it, so a single mis-set field cannot stop a counter for good. |
| `beecounter_night_max_traffic` | Crossings (in + out) in the last upload cycle above which night mode is postponed to the next cycle. `0` disables the check. |
| `timezone` | POSIX TZ string, e.g. `CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3`. Empty means UTC. |

The `beecounter_bank*_enabled` fields configure **HiveTraffic emitter banks** —
see [hivetraffic-bee-counter.md](hivetraffic-bee-counter.md#emitter-banks).
Applied on every config fetch for the same reason the night-mode fields are.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `beecounter_bank1_enabled` | Emitter MOSFET for gates 00–07. `true` by default. |
| `beecounter_bank2_enabled` | Emitter MOSFET for gates 10–17. `true` by default. |
| `beecounter_bank3_enabled` | Emitter MOSFET for gates 20–27. `true` by default. |

A counter's 48 IR emitters sit behind three MOSFETs, one per group of eight
gates, and they dominate its power draw. Measured on the counter's 3.3 V rail:
one bank ~0.14 A, two ~0.22 A, three ~0.30 A — roughly 80 mA per bank on top of
a ~60 mA floor. Switching one off stops its eight gates being counted at all, so
the totals drop in proportion; the counter reports the mask back as
`hives[].bee_counter.banks` so a deliberately dark bank is distinguishable from
a failed one.

A PATCH that would leave **all three** disabled is rejected with `400`. The
counter refuses a mask of zero outright — it keeps the mask it had — so storing
one would only leave the dashboard and the hardware permanently disagreeing. A
counter that should count nothing is unpaired instead.

The device requires HiveTraffic firmware 0.3.0 (wire revision 5) or newer to
apply the mask; on an older counter the write is skipped and all three banks
stay on.

`timezone` is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The device clock is UTC, so
without it a window entered as 20:00 fires at 21:00 local in summer — discarding
an hour of foraging on exactly the long evenings that have most of it. It is a
POSIX string rather than an IANA name because the ESP32 carries no tz database;
newlib parses this form directly, DST rules included. The dashboard offers
presets for the common zones and a free-text field for anything else.

The `tempco_*` fields drive backend load-cell temperature compensation. They are
informational for the device (which keeps sending raw weights); the correction is
applied in the backend on read. See
[temperature-compensation.md](temperature-compensation.md).

Since firmware 0.23.5 the device applies the `scale*_offset`/`scale*_factor`
fields to its hive registry **only when `config_version` differs from the last
version it applied** (stored in NVS). A calibration done locally on the
provisioning portal's `/calibrate` page therefore survives config fetches; to
override it from the backend, change the values here (any `PATCH` bumps
`config_version`, which makes the device adopt them on its next cycle).

Since firmware 0.23.7 the device also **reports a portal calibration back to the
server**. The provisioning AP is offline, so a tare/span done there (and a
"Save and reboot" that carries one) only sets a pending flag in NVS. On the first
cycle with WiFi after the reboot, the device `PATCH`es its live calibration so the
backend no longer holds only defaults: hives 1–2 in the `scale1/2_offset` +
`factor` fields, and **hives 3+ in the `hive_scales` array** (below). That
`PATCH` bumps `config_version`; the device records the returned version as its
last-applied one, so the config fetch in the same cycle does not bridge those
values straight back.

The GET response includes a `hive_scales` array carrying the stored calibration
for hives 3+ (hives 1–2 stay in the `scale1/2_*` fields):

```json
"hive_scales": [
  { "index": 5, "scale": 0, "offset": 123, "factor": -7100.0, "tempco_kg_per_c": -0.004 }
]
```

A `PATCH` may send the same array to set them; each entry updates one hive
(omitted `offset`/`factor`/`tempco_kg_per_c` keep their current value). These are
stored per hive in `device_configs.scale_offsets_by_hive` and, like the legacy
fields, are bridged into the firmware's hive registry when `config_version`
changes — except `tempco_kg_per_c`, which is a backend read-time correction the
device never consumes (the hives 3+ counterpart of `scale1/2_tempco_kg_per_c`,
sharing the device-wide `tempco_enabled` / `tempco_source` / `tempco_ref_temp_c`
settings).

### `PATCH /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/config`

Updates one or more config fields and increments `config_version`.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (per-device key)

```json
{
  "send_interval_seconds": 300,
  "scale1_factor": -7200.0
}
```

## Firmware OTA

### `GET /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/firmware`

Checks whether a newer active firmware release is available for the given target.

The release is resolved **owner-first**: the backend looks up the device's owner
and serves that owner's most recent active release, falling back to a global /
"official" release (one with no owner) when the owner has none. A scale therefore
only ever sees firmware its own owner uploaded, or an official build.

For the `hivescale` self-update this endpoint is also **accept-to-apply**: it
returns `update: true` only once the owner has approved that exact version for the
device (`POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/firmware/approve`). Until then it
reports no update, so publishing firmware never auto-flashes a whole fleet. The
sub-device target (`hiveinside`) is relayed explicitly via commands and is not
gated here.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (per-device key)

| Query parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | `0.0.0` | Current device firmware version |
| `target` | `hivescale` | `hivescale` (the ESP32 itself) or `hiveinside`. The `hivehub` alias is also accepted and treated as `hivescale`. |

No update:

```json
{ "update": false, "update_available": false }
```

Update available:

```json
{
  "update": true,
  "update_available": true,
  "version": "0.9.3",
  "url": "https://your-domain.example.com/firmware/hivescale-0.9.3.bin",
  "size": 1276928,
  "crc32": 2843490522
}
```

> The response carries both `update` and `update_available` with the same value:
> the ESP32 reads `update`, while older clients read `update_available`.
>
> `size` (bytes) and `crc32` (unsigned CRC-32 of the image file) let the device
> flash safely even when the download arrives without a `Content-Length` header
> — a reverse proxy/CDN (e.g. Cloudflare) may deliver the binary with
> `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` — and verify the received image before rebooting.
> `0` means unknown; firmware ≤ 0.23.5 ignores both fields.

### `POST /api/v1/firmware/releases`

Registers or updates a firmware release. The binary must already exist in `FIRMWARE_DIR`. The server computes and stores the image CRC-32.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (master/admin key)

```json
{
  "version": "0.9.3",
  "filename": "hivescale-0.9.3.bin",
  "active": true,
  "target": "hivescale"
}
```

`target` defaults to `hivescale` and may also be `hiveinside` or `beecounter`
(the HiveTraffic counter). Response:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "version": "0.9.3", "target": "hivescale", "crc32": 2882343476 }
```

### `GET /firmware/{filename}`

Downloads a firmware binary. This endpoint has no API-key requirement; the URL is normally obtained from the firmware check endpoint.

### `POST /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/commands/update-hiveinside`

Queues an `update_hiveinside` command that tells the HiveHub to relay the active
HiveInside firmware image to the HiveInside sensor paired in the given slot over
BLE GATT. The image URL, version, and CRC-32 are looked up server-side and embedded
in the command payload; the HiveHub resolves the BLE MAC locally.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (master/admin key)

| Query parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slot` | `1` | Hive index (`1`..`18`) carrying the HiveInside to update |
| `force` | `false` | Relay even when the release is not newer than the running version |

`slot` is the **hive index**: the HiveHub resolves it against its hive registry
and matches only HiveInside pairings, so any hive can be updated. (Before 0.24.6
the slot addressed the legacy two-element `bleSensorMac0/1` globals, which held
the first beacon of *any* type — hives 3+ were unreachable and a hive whose first
pairing was a HolyIot/RuuviTag aimed the relay at the wrong device.)

The relay is **version-gated**: the release must be strictly newer than the
firmware version that node last advertised (`hives[].ble.firmware_version`, seen
within the last 30 days). A node that has never advertised a version is not
gated, since there is nothing to compare against.

Returns `400` for a slot outside `1..18`, `404` if there is no active
`hiveinside` release, and `409` when the release is not newer:

```json
{ "detail": "HiveInside on hive 1 already runs 0.4.1; release 0.4.1 is not newer. Upload a higher version, or pass force=true to relay it anyway." }
```

### `POST /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/commands/update-beecounter`

Queues an `update_beecounter` command that tells the HiveHub to relay the active
`beecounter` firmware image to the HiveTraffic counter paired in the given slot
over BLE GATT. Identical mechanics to `update-hiveinside` above — same
server-side URL/CRC lookup, same local MAC resolution, same query parameters,
same `400`/`404`/`409` responses.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (master/admin key)

| Query parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slot` | `1` | Hive index (`1`..`18`) carrying the counter to update |
| `force` | `false` | Relay even when the release is not newer than the running version |

The version compared is the counter's own image version, reported as
`hives[].bee_counter.version` (the `"ver"` field of its measurement JSON). A
counter on firmware that predates that field reports none and is therefore never
gated.

**The counter stops counting bees for the whole transfer.** It parks its IR
emitters and pauses gate polling while writing flash, so an unnecessary relay
costs real traffic data — which is what the version gate exists to prevent.
Prefer relaying at night or in poor flying weather.

Response on success — `current_version` is the version being replaced (`null`
when the node never advertised one):

```json
{ "id": 72, "status": "pending", "slot": 1, "version": "0.4.1", "current_version": "0.4.0" }
```

> The HiveHub reports the command result **after** the relay finishes, so the
> command transitions `pending` → `claimed` → `done`/`failed` reflecting the real
> outcome. A failed relay records a specific cause in the command result message
> (e.g. `HiveInside not found in scan (asleep or out of range?)`,
> `firmware download failed (HTTP 404)`, `HiveInside rejected image (… CRC/size
> mismatch?)`). The HiveInside must be awake/advertising during the locate scan.

---

## Remote commands

Commands are queued server-side and claimed by the device on a later cycle. A
command is picked up **once per upload cycle**, in every mode — there is no
separate command poll.

### Lifecycle and abandoned claims

A command moves `pending` → `claimed` → `done`/`failed`. Because
`commands/next` only ever serves `pending` rows, a claim the device never
reports on would otherwise be invisible to every later poll — never retried and
never failed. The device does not have to crash for that to happen: the result
POST is fire-and-forget, so a Wi-Fi hiccup right after a multi-minute BLE relay
strands the row just the same.

The backend therefore sweeps stale claims (cheap and idempotent, run before
serving a command — no background job):

| Setting | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `STALE_CLAIM_MINUTES` | `20` | A claim older than this with no result is abandoned |
| `MAX_COMMAND_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | How often one command may be handed out before it is failed for good |
| `RETRYABLE_COMMAND_TYPES` | `update_hiveinside`, `update_beecounter` | Only these go back on the queue |

Retryable commands return to `pending` until the attempt limit, then fail with
`timed out: claimed by the device N time(s) without reporting a result`.
Everything else fails on the **first** timeout rather than being repeated —
silently re-running a `factory_reset` or `reset_wifi` because a result POST was
lost would destroy state the operator asked to change exactly once. Either way
the row reaches a terminal state, so the dashboard shows an outcome instead of a
permanent "relaying…". The attempt counter lives in `device_commands.attempts`
(migration `021_device_command_attempts.sql`).

### `POST /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/commands`

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (master/admin key)

```json
{
  "command_type": "start_calibration_mode",
  "payload": {"interval_seconds": 5, "timeout_seconds": 600}
}
```

| Command type | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `calibrate_scale_1` | `{"known_weight_kg": 10.0}` | Set scale 1 calibration factor using a known weight |
| `calibrate_scale_2` | `{"known_weight_kg": 10.0}` | Set scale 2 calibration factor using a known weight |
| `start_calibration_mode` | `{"interval_seconds": 5, "timeout_seconds": 600}` | Temporarily use fast cycles for calibration |
| `stop_calibration_mode` | `{}` | Return to the normal configured interval |
| `start_inspection` | `{}` | Flag hive readings as taken with the hive open — see [inspection-mode.md](inspection-mode.md). Prefer the `/inspections/start` endpoints below, which also record the window |
| `stop_inspection` | `{}` | End inspection mode |
| `reboot` | `{}` | Restart ESP32 |
| `reset_preferences` | `{}` | Clear stored preferences and reboot |
| `factory_reset` | `{}` | Factory reset stored preferences and reboot |
| `reset_wifi` | `{}` | Clear saved Wi-Fi credentials and reboot |
| `check_ota` / `ota_update` | `{}` | Trigger immediate OTA check/update |
| `update_hiveinside` | `{"slot": 1, "url": "...", "version": "...", "crc32": 123}` | Relay a firmware image to a HiveInside sensor over BLE GATT (normally queued via the `update-hiveinside` helper above) |
| `update_beecounter` | `{"slot": 1, "url": "...", "version": "...", "crc32": 123}` | Relay a firmware image to a HiveTraffic counter over BLE GATT (normally queued via the `update-beecounter` helper above) |
| `start_provisioning` | `{}` | Start the provisioning AP — the remote equivalent of a press on the setup button. The device opens it at the end of the cycle that picked the command up, and closes it again on the portal timeout. From firmware 0.25.5 it **reboots first** when the portal's BLE pairing scan would otherwise be unable to run (the usual case once a sensor is paired), so the AP appears a few seconds later and after one extra boot; the command result is posted before the reboot. Also queued by the dashboard's **Device & admin → Configuration → Start AP mode** button (`POST /api/v1/local/devices/{device_id}/provisioning/start`, admin) |

Response:

```json
{ "status": "queued", "id": 55 }
```

### `GET /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/commands/next`

Claims the next pending command and marks it as claimed.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (per-device key)

No command:

```json
{ "command": false }
```

Command returned:

```json
{
  "command": true,
  "id": 55,
  "command_type": "start_calibration_mode",
  "payload": {"interval_seconds": 5, "timeout_seconds": 600}
}
```

### `POST /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/commands/{command_id}/result`

Reports command success or failure. Calibration command results can include updated offset/factor values; the server applies them to `device_configs`.

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` (per-device key)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Calibration applied",
  "result": {
    "scale1_factor": -7050.0
  }
}
```

## App endpoints for HivePal

All app endpoints require both `X-HivePal-Service-Key` and an `Authorization: Bearer <hivepal-jwt>` header. The user is identified by the verified token's `sub` claim.

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `owner` | Full access, including member management and removal |
| `admin` | Read plus config/channel writes |
| `viewer` | Read-only access |

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/claim`

Claims an unclaimed device by claim code. The device must have sent at least one measurement containing that claim code — or have been re-seeded by hand from the local dashboard (**Device & admin → Admin → Re-seed to HivePal**, `POST /api/v1/local/devices/{device_id}/reseed`), which registers a device_id and claim code exactly as a first upload does.

```json
{
  "claim_code": "ABCD-1234",
  "display_name": "Back garden scale",
  "scale_1_display_name": "Hive A",
  "scale_2_display_name": "Hive B"
}
```

Failure modes are reported separately, because they need different fixes:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `404` | No device on this server has ever sent that claim code. Check the code, and check the device has uploaded at least once. A device whose row was deleted here, whose firmware stopped sending the code before the server had it, or that was re-flashed with a new code will keep answering `404` until it is re-seeded from the dashboard (see above). |
| `409` | The code matches a device that is already claimed. If you are already a member it is in your device list; otherwise its owner must release it first (see below). |

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices`

Lists all devices the current user can access. Device objects include `device_id`, `display_name`, `claimed_at`, `last_seen_at`, `last_firmware_version`, `role`, and `channels`.

### `DELETE /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}`

Removes the current user's membership. When that was the last member, the device is released — `claimed_at` is cleared and its claim code pairs it again.

```json
{ "status": "removed", "device_id": "hive_scale_01", "released": true }
```

`released` is `false` when other members still hold the device; it stays claimed for them and the claim code will not work until they leave too (or the owner releases it outright).

Measurements, config and channel names are kept, so re-claiming restores the history. To erase the data as well, use the local dashboard's device delete.

### `DELETE /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/claim`

Owner only. Releases the device outright: removes **every** member and clears `claimed_at`, so it can be claimed again with its claim code. Use this instead of removing yourself when a shared device needs to be re-paired or handed on — otherwise it stays claimed until each member happens to remove themselves.

```json
{ "status": "released", "device_id": "hive_scale_01", "members_removed": 3 }
```

Readings, config and channel names are untouched; only the pairing is undone.

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/channels`

Returns channel display names for scale 1 and scale 2.

### `PATCH /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/channels`

Updates channel display names. Requires `owner` or `admin`.

```json
{
  "scale_1_display_name": "Buckfast colony",
  "scale_2_display_name": "Carnica colony"
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/config`

Returns the same device config schema as the device-facing config endpoint. Any role may read.

### `PATCH /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/config`

Updates config fields. Requires `owner` or `admin`. Accepts the `tempco_*`
temperature-compensation fields in addition to the calibration fields.

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/temp-compensation/fit`

Fits a load-cell temperature coefficient from the device's own history by
regressing a scale's raw weight against an EMA-smoothed temperature channel (the
same smoothing applied at read time). A plain fit needs
`viewer`; persisting it (`apply: true`) needs `owner`/`admin`. See
[temperature-compensation.md](temperature-compensation.md).

```json
{
  "scale": 1,
  "lookback_days": 3,
  "temp_source": "ambient",
  "calibration_mode_only": false,
  "apply": true,
  "set_ref_temp": false
}
```

`scale` is a hive index, 1–18. Hives 1–2 are fitted from the `measurements`
table's weight columns, hives 3+ from their `hive_readings` rows.

Returns the fit (`coeff_kg_per_c`, `ref_temp_c`, `r_squared`, sample count and
temperature span). When `apply` is true and the fit succeeds, the coefficient and
source are written to the config and compensation is enabled — into
`scale{1,2}_tempco_kg_per_c` for hives 1–2, and into that hive's `hive_scales`
entry for hives 3+.

`tempco_ref_temp_c` is **not** touched unless `set_ref_temp` is true. The
reference is the temperature at which the scale reads true (the one it was tared
and spanned at), which a regression cannot recover; the returned `ref_temp_c` is
just the window's mean temperature, offered as a fallback when the calibration
temperature is unknown.

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/measurements`

Returns measurements for one device.

| Query parameter | Default | Max | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `limit` | 200 | 10000 | Number of rows |
| `start_at` | - | - | ISO datetime lower bound |
| `end_at` | - | - | ISO datetime upper bound |

The response includes off-grid fields when the firmware sends them, plus
`scale_{n}_weight_kg_compensated` for every hive (mirrored onto each `hives[]`
entry as `weight_kg_compensated`) and a `tempco_applied` flag. The compensated values apply the per-device coefficient to
an EMA-smoothed temperature (see
[temperature-compensation.md](temperature-compensation.md)). When compensation is
disabled the compensated values equal the raw weights and `tempco_applied` is
`false`.

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/measurements/latest`

Returns the newest measurements for one device.

| Query parameter | Default | Max | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `limit` | 50 | 500 | Number of rows |

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/measurements/import`

Bulk-imports measurements parsed from a device's SD card backup
(`measurements.ndjson` / the AP-mode `hivescale-sd-data.tar` download). Used by
the HivePal web UI's "Import SD card data" button. Requires `owner` or `admin`
on the device — devices are never auto-created from uploaded data.

The request body is the same measurement objects as `POST /api/v1/measurements`,
wrapped in a list (max 20000 per request; `device_id` is taken from the URL and
forced onto every row):

```json
{
  "measurements": [
    { "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:45Z", "scale_1_weight_kg": 42.1 },
    { "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:40:45Z", "scale_1_weight_kg": 42.3 }
  ]
}
```

Import is idempotent: `(device_id, measured_at)` is the natural key, so rows that
already exist — and rows repeated within the file — are skipped, not duplicated.

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "received": 2,
  "inserted": 2,
  "duplicates": 0
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/members`

Lists members and roles.

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/members`

Shares a device with another HivePal user ID. Requires `owner`.

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-002",
  "role": "viewer"
}
```

### `DELETE /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/members/{user_id}`

Revokes another user's access. Requires `owner`.

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/calibration/start`

Queues a `start_calibration_mode` command. Requires `owner` or `admin`. The body is optional.

| Field | Type | Default | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `interval_seconds` | int | 5 | 1 ≤ value ≤ 3600 |
| `timeout_seconds` | int | 600 | 1 ≤ value ≤ 86400 |

```json
{ "status": "pending", "id": 42, "command_type": "start_calibration_mode", "payload": { "interval_seconds": 5, "timeout_seconds": 600 } }
```

> The backend validates the ranges above; the firmware additionally clamps the
> interval to 2–30 s and the timeout to at most 30 minutes. See
> [calibration-mode.md](calibration-mode.md).

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/calibration/stop`

Queues a `stop_calibration_mode` command. Requires `owner` or `admin`. No body.

```json
{ "status": "pending", "id": 43, "command_type": "stop_calibration_mode", "payload": {} }
```

<a id="inspections"></a>

## Inspections

The window while a beekeeper has a hive open, during which its own readings
measure the inspection rather than the colony. The hub keeps measuring and
uploading throughout; the backend records the window and keeps the readings
inside it out of charts, insights and alert rules. **Nothing is deleted** — the
export and each row's `raw_json` still carry the raw numbers. Full behaviour:
[inspection-mode.md](inspection-mode.md).

Each endpoint exists twice: under `/api/v1/devices/...` with the master
`X-API-Key`, and under `/api/v1/app/devices/...` with the HivePal service key
plus a user with the right role. The bodies and responses are identical.

Inspections are also readable and controllable from the local dashboard at
`/api/v1/local/devices/{device_id}/inspections[...]` (reads: any dashboard
session; start/stop/patch: admin).

### `POST /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/inspections/start`

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` · app variant requires `owner` or `admin`.
Body optional.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hives` | int[] | all hives | Scope the inspection to these hive indexes (1–18). Omit for the whole hub, which is what the physical button always means |
| `note` | string | – | Free text, e.g. `"removed 2 supers"` |
| `started_at` | ISO-8601 | now | Back-date the start. HivePal knows when the beekeeper actually opened the hive; the request may arrive minutes later over a bad rural connection |

Opens the window **and** queues a `start_inspection` command for the device.
Idempotent: calling it while an inspection is already open returns that
inspection and queues nothing.

```json
{
  "id": 17, "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01", "hives": null,
  "started_at": "2026-06-01T12:00:00Z", "ended_at": null, "active": true,
  "source": "api", "end_reason": null,
  "requested_at": "2026-06-01T12:00:00Z", "acknowledged_at": null,
  "note": "removed 2 supers", "created_by": "user-123"
}
```

`acknowledged_at` is `null` until the hub picks the command up. **That
distinction matters:** the hub deep-sleeps between cycles, so an inspection is
*requested* for up to a whole send interval before it is *running*. A UI that
renders the two the same is claiming something that has not happened yet.

### `POST /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/inspections/stop`

**Auth:** `X-API-Key` · app variant requires `owner` or `admin`.
Body optional: `note` (string), `ended_at` (ISO-8601, back-dates the end).

Closes the open window and queues a `stop_inspection` command. Returns the
closed inspection, or `null` if none was open — the command is queued either
way, because a hub still flagging its readings with no matching record is the
one failure mode that silently blanks a hive.

### `GET /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/inspections/status`

Is this hub inspecting, and does it know it yet?

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "active": false,
  "pending": true,
  "inspection": { "id": 17, "...": "as above" },
  "timeout_minutes": 60
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | The hub has confirmed it: readings are being masked right now |
| `pending` | Requested, not yet picked up by the hub |
| `timeout_minutes` | After this long, hub and server both end the inspection (`end_reason: "timeout"`). Configured per device as `inspection_timeout_minutes` |

### `GET /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/inspections`

Inspections **overlapping** a time range — what a chart shades.

| Query | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `start_at` / `end_at` | unbounded | ISO-8601 range. Overlap, not containment: an inspection that started before the window is exactly the one explaining the step at its left edge |
| `limit` | 200 | 1–2000 |

### `PATCH /api/v1/devices/{device_id}/inspections/{inspection_id}`

Sets the `note` on a recorded inspection. Requires `owner` or `admin` on the app
variant.

```json
{ "note": "removed 2 supers, replaced queen excluder" }
```

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/firmware`

Uploads a firmware binary as `multipart/form-data` and registers it as a release.
Requires `owner` or `admin`. Unlike `POST /api/v1/firmware/releases` (device key,
file must already be in `FIRMWARE_DIR`), this endpoint accepts the binary itself,
writes it into `FIRMWARE_DIR`, computes its CRC-32, and upserts the release.

The release is **scoped to the device's owner** (`owner_user_id`), so only scales
owned by the same user are offered it — the upload no longer reaches the whole
fleet. Pushing a global / official build is still done with the master-key
`POST /api/v1/firmware/releases`, which leaves the release un-owned.

| Form field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `file` | Yes | The firmware binary |
| `version` | Yes | Release version string |
| `target` | No | `hivescale` (default), `hiveinside` or `beecounter`. **`hivehub` is accepted as an alias for `hivescale`** and is stored as `hivescale`, so HiveHub firmware needs no special handling. |
| `active` | No | Whether the release is active (default `true`) |

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.9.3",
  "filename": "hivescale-0.9.3.bin",
  "target": "hivescale",
  "active": true,
  "size_bytes": 1048576,
  "crc32": 2882343476
}
```

> **Uploading only registers the release; it does not start a relay or auto-flash.**
> For a `hivescale` target the owner must still approve the update per device (see
> `firmware/status` and `firmware/approve` below) before any scale installs it. For
> a `hiveinside` target, queue the OTA with the trigger endpoint
> below after the upload. Releases are unique per `(owner, target, version)`, so the
> same version number can coexist across owners and across
> `hivescale`/`hiveinside`.

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/firmware/status`

Reports the device's firmware-update status for the HivePal setup panel. Any role
may read. `current_version` is what the device last reported; `latest_version` is
the newest active `hivescale` release resolved owner-first (the owner's own build,
else a global/official one). `update_available` means `latest_version` is newer
than `current_version`; `pending_approval` means an update is available but the
owner has not approved it yet, so the device will **not** auto-flash until they do.

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "target": "hivescale",
  "current_version": "0.9.2",
  "latest_version": "0.9.3",
  "latest_is_official": false,
  "approved_version": null,
  "update_available": true,
  "pending_approval": true
}
```

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/firmware/approve`

Approves the latest available `hivescale` firmware so this device may install it —
the accept-to-apply step behind the HivePal panel's "Apply update" button. Records
the approved version (so the device-facing firmware check starts returning
`update: true` for this device) and queues an `ota_update` command to nudge the
scale to update on its next check-in instead of waiting for its scheduled OTA poll.
Requires `owner` or `admin`. Returns `404` if there is no release available.

```json
{ "status": "approved", "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01", "version": "0.9.3", "command_id": 88 }
```

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/commands/update-hiveinside`

Queues an `update_hiveinside` command so the HiveHub relays the active HiveInside
release to the paired sensor over BLE. This is the app-facing counterpart of the
device-key `…/commands/update-hiveinside` helper; it authenticates with the HivePal
service key + user JWT and requires `owner` or `admin` on the device.

| Query parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `slot` | `1` | Hive index (`1`..`18`) carrying the HiveInside to update |
| `force` | `false` | Relay even when the release is not newer than the running version |

Same slot semantics and version gate as the device-key endpoint above: `400` for
a slot outside `1..18`, `404` when no active `hiveinside` release exists, `409`
when the release is not newer than the version the node advertises.

```json
{ "status": "pending", "id": 72, "command_type": "update_hiveinside", "payload": { "slot": 1 }, "version": "0.4.1", "current_version": "0.4.0" }
```

### `POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/commands/update-beecounter`

The HiveTraffic counter equivalent of the endpoint above: same auth (HivePal
service key + user JWT, `owner`/`admin` on the device), same query parameters,
same slot semantics and version gate. Note the counter stops counting for the
duration of the transfer.

```json
{ "status": "pending", "id": 73, "command_type": "update_beecounter", "payload": { "slot": 1 }, "version": "0.2.0", "current_version": "0.1.0" }
```

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/insights`

Computes rule-based colony alerts over recent measurements. Any role may read.
See [insights.md](insights.md) for the detector catalogue and literature sources.

| Query parameter | Default | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lookback_days` | 14 | 1 ≤ value ≤ 90 | Days of history evaluated |

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "computed_at": "2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "lookback_days": 14,
  "measurement_count": 1280,
  "alerts": [ { "severity": "watch", "category": "swarm", "title": "Pre-swarm watch", "...": "..." } ]
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/insights/summary`

Highest-severity summary of current alerts (fixed 14-day lookback), suitable for dashboard cards.

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "computed_at": "2026-05-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "alert_count": 3,
  "highest_severity": "warning",
  "highest_alert": { "severity": "warning", "category": "swarm", "...": "..." },
  "categories": { "swarm": 1, "foraging": 1, "brood": 1 }
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/insights/history`

Persisted **history** of insight alerts for the device. Unlike `/insights`
(which recomputes the *current* state on each call and stores nothing), this
returns the stored lifecycle of every alert the backend has observed —
including ones that have since resolved — newest first. Any role may read.

Alert lifecycle is reconciled by a background thread (see
`INSIGHTS_RECONCILE_*` in [.env.example](../server/.env.example)) and
opportunistically whenever `/insights/summary` is hit. While a detector keeps
firing the same row is updated (`last_seen_at` bumped, `peak_severity`
tracked); when it stops firing the row is resolved (`resolved_at` set). A later
recurrence of the same detector starts a new row.

| Query parameter | Default | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | `all` | `all` \| `active` \| `resolved` | Filter by lifecycle state |
| `category` | — | swarm, queenless, robbing, … | Filter by detector category |
| `since` | — | ISO 8601 | Only alerts last seen at/after this time |
| `limit` | 100 | 1 ≤ value ≤ 500 | Max rows returned |

```json
{
  "device_id": "hive_scale_dual_01",
  "lookback_days": 14,
  "count": 2,
  "active_count": 1,
  "alerts": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "alert_key": "swarm-watch-ch1",
      "category": "swarm",
      "channel": 1,
      "severity": "watch",
      "peak_severity": "warning",
      "title": "Pre-swarm watch (hive 1)",
      "description": "...",

## Database schema

The backend auto-creates and updates the schema on startup.

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `devices` | Device identity, claim status, per-device API key hash, display name, last seen, firmware version, and the owner-approved firmware version (accept-to-apply gate) |
| `device_members` | Users with `owner`, `admin`, or `viewer` role per device |
| `device_channels` | Display names for scale channel 1 and 2 |
| `device_configs` | Send interval, offsets, calibration factors, config version, bee-counter night mode |
| `measurements` | Measurement records, including power/acoustic/bee-counter columns and `raw_json` |
| `firmware_releases` | Firmware versions available for OTA, with `target`, `crc32`, and `owner_user_id` (NULL = global/official; otherwise the owner the release is private to) |
| `device_commands` | Pending, claimed, done, and failed commands, with the `attempts` counter used to recover abandoned claims |
| `insight_alerts` | Persisted lifecycle of insight alerts (first/last seen, peak severity, resolution) powering the history endpoint |

The backend creates the full schema on startup and runs idempotent `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` statements, so existing deployments upgrade automatically. Columns cover power telemetry (battery/solar), calibration mode, boot count, time source, INMP441 acoustic levels + FFT bands, per-hive HiveTraffic bee-counter counts (BLE/GATT), load-cell temperature-compensation config, per-hive vibration bands, in-hive BLE humidity/pressure, the beehivemonitoring.com `hiveheart_*` / `hivescale_*` fields, the normalized per-hive `hive_readings` table (multi-hive payloads), and the dashboard-auth tables (`dashboard_users`, `dashboard_settings`, `push_subscriptions`); `firmware_releases` gains `target`, `crc32`, `owner_user_id`, and `board`; `device_commands` gains `attempts`. The SQL files in `server/migrations/` (`001_offgrid_telemetry.sql` through `021_device_command_attempts.sql`) can also be applied manually. All fields remain available in `raw_json` for forward compatibility.
