// gatt_audio.h — GATT client for HiveInside's authenticated audio stream.
//
// HiveInside 0.6.0 and later expose an on-request microphone: an authenticated
// START makes the node capture 16 kHz PCM16 and push it out as GATT
// notifications. HiveHub is the only node with WiFi, so it relays that stream
// to the backend exactly as it relays firmware in the other direction — see
// gatt_ota.h, whose Target/begin/…/cleanup shape this mirrors.
//
// The protocol is documented in HiveInside docs/audio-over-ble.md. In short:
//
//   service  8e8b0002-7a1c-4b9e-9a2f-1d6e0b9c1a01
//   CTRL     8e8b0020-…  write   0x01 START | 0x02 STOP
//   DATA     8e8b0021-…  notify  seq(2 LE) flags(1) reserved(1) PCM16 LE
//   STATUS   8e8b0023-…  read/notify  30-byte session record
//
// Three things about this transport differ from the OTA one and drive the
// design here:
//
//   * It is INBOUND. Notifications arrive on the NimBLE host task, which must
//     never block on TLS, so they are copied into a ring buffer that the caller
//     drains from its own loop. Sizing that ring is the whole trick: the node
//     produces 32 kB/s and does not wait for us.
//   * It is AUTHENTICATED. The node issues a nonce in STATUS; START must carry
//     HMAC-SHA256(psk, nonce || op || duration | rate | format | gain)
//     truncated to eight bytes. Without a provisioned key the node fails closed
//     and no recording is possible — that is deliberate, not a bug to work
//     around.
//   * It may be OPEN-ENDED. durationDs == 0 means "stream until STOP", which is
//     what the dashboard's live listening uses. The node still stops itself at
//     60 s, so a lost STOP costs one minute of audio, never an open microphone.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   begin(mac, durationDs, gainDb) → read(buf,n)… while streaming() → stop()
//   → finish(&stats) → cleanup()
// cleanup() releases the NimBLE stack and the ring, and is safe to call at any
// point after begin() — including after a failed begin().
