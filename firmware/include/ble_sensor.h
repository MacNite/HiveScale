// ble_sensor.h — passive BLE bridge for the HolyIot 25015 in-hive sensor.
//
// The HolyIot 25015 (nRF54L15) is a battery BLE beacon that broadcasts the
// readings of three on-board sensors:
//   - SHT40   : temperature + relative humidity
//   - LPS22HB : barometric pressure
//   - LIS2DH12: 3-axis acceleration
//
// The ESP32 never connects to the device. Once per upload cycle it runs a short
// passive scan (HOLYIOT_BLE_SCAN_SECONDS), matches advertisements against the
// one or two MAC addresses paired in the provisioning portal, parses the
// manufacturer-specific payload and folds the values into the measurement JSON:
//
//   slot 1 -> hive 1   (bleSensorMac0)
//   slot 2 -> hive 2   (bleSensorMac1)
//
// Per the data-model decision, the acceleration is reported through the existing
// accel_{slot}_* measurement fields (ok / rms_mg / peak_mg / sample_count /
// range_g); temperature, humidity and pressure are reported through new
// ble_{slot}_* fields. Because a passive beacon only emits periodic single-shot
// samples, no FFT bands are produced — the server runs a low-rate pre-swarm
// detector on the per-cycle acceleration magnitude instead.
//
// The whole feature is compiled out unless ENABLE_BLE_SCAN is set.
