// XIAO ESP32-C6 — BOARD-SPECIFIC SENSOR SET
// ==============================
// The C6 variant breaks out only the 11 front-header pins (D0–D10). Two wired
// peripherals from the classic board do not fit and are force-compiled out for
// this target — overriding whatever a secrets.h carried over from an ESP32 build
// (or the default of 1) may set:
//   - HX711: each amp needs a dedicated DOUT/SCK pin pair (two pairs = 4 pins).
//     The C6 reads load cells through I2C NAU7802 channels (D4/D5) instead, so
//     no HX711 driver is compiled in and no scale1/scale2 objects exist.
//   - INMP441 I2S microphone: no spare I2S-capable pins.
//
// A single DS18B20 1-Wire bus IS supported on the C6. With HX711 removed, D1 is
// free, so the V0.4 breakout can wire a DS18B20 there (ONE_WIRE_PIN in the C6 pin
// map below). As of v0.24.0 the DS18B20 stack is OPTIONAL and defaults OFF on
// every board (in-hive temperature comes from a paired BLE sensor instead), and
// its OneWire/DallasTemperature libraries are commented out in platformio.ini.
// To use a wired probe, set ENABLE_DS18B20_HIVE_TEMP 1 in secrets.h AND
// uncomment those two libraries for the matching env — see the notes there.
//
// Two guards for the same condition:
//   HIVEHUB_BOARD_XIAO_C6  — set by [env:xiao_esp32c6] build_flags; available
