"""Load-cell temperature compensation — pure, database-free logic.

HX711/load-cell readings drift with temperature: the bridge resistance and the
mechanical structure both change with ambient temperature, so an *unchanged*
physical load is reported as a slowly varying weight. On a beehive that drift
masquerades as nectar income at midday and as consumption overnight.

The firmware already ships everything needed to correct this after the fact —
every measurement carries the raw load-cell weight *and* an ambient temperature
(``ambient_temp_c`` from the SHT4x, plus the two DS18B20 hive probes). We keep
the raw values untouched in the database and apply a first-order correction on
read, using a per-device, per-scale coefficient. Because the raw data is never
mutated, the coefficient can be re-tuned (or disabled) at any time without
losing anything.

Model
-----
A first-order (linear) correction around a reference temperature::

    compensated_kg = raw_kg - coeff_kg_per_c * (temp_c - ref_temp_c)

* ``coeff_kg_per_c`` is the observed drift of the *reported* weight per °C.
  Positive means the scale reads heavier as it warms; we subtract that drift.
* ``ref_temp_c`` is the temperature at which the correction is zero — i.e. the
  temperature the compensated reading is normalized to. Picking the mean
  temperature of the calibration window keeps the correction centered and small.

The coefficient is expressed directly in **kg per °C** (not ppm/°C of span) so
it applies to the stored kilogram value without needing to know the cell's
full-scale span. Typical strain-gauge cells drift on the order of a few grams
per °C, but measuring your own from logged data (see :func:`fit_temp_coefficient`)
beats any datasheet number.

These functions are deliberately free of FastAPI/psycopg imports so they can be
unit-tested with no database or server (see test-data/test_tempcomp.py).
