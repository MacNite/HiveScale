# not meaningfully compressible, the WAV endpoint sets an explicit
# Content-Length that gzip would invalidate, and the live player reads exact
# byte offsets out of the PCM endpoint — a re-framed body would misalign every

    Compressing the measurement JSON is a large win, but applying it to
    ``GET /firmware/{filename}`` actively breaks OTA. A gzipped response is
    streamed without a ``Content-Length``, and the ESP32 sizes its download from
    that header: ``HTTPClient::getSize()`` returns -1, so the HiveInside relay
    fails with "invalid firmware content length -1" before it ever opens the BLE
    session, and the hub's own self-update falls back to the backend-supplied
    size. Firmware images are already-compact binaries, so compressing them costs
    CPU on both ends and saves nothing.

    Implemented as a wrapper rather than a GZipMiddleware subclass because
    Starlette's implementation decides to compress inside its own ASGI callable,
    with no hook for excluding a path.
