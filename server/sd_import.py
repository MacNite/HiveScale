"""Helpers for bulk-importing measurements parsed from a HiveScale SD card.

The ESP32 keeps an append-only ``/measurements.ndjson`` backup on its SD card.
A beekeeper can pull that file in AP mode and upload it later through the HivePal
web UI, which forwards the parsed records to
``POST /api/v1/app/devices/{device_id}/measurements/import``.

The same measurement can legitimately appear more than once — the backup file is
never pruned, the retry cache replays rows, and a beekeeper may upload the same
download twice. Re-importing must therefore be idempotent. We treat
``(device_id, measured_at)`` as the natural key for a reading: the firmware only
produces one sample per wake-up, so two rows for the same device and instant are
the same observation.

This module intentionally has **no** third-party imports so the de-duplication
logic can be unit-tested without a database or FastAPI.
