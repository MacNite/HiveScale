# /api/v1/devices/*, the dashboard session drives /api/v1/local/*, and HivePal
# users reach the same functions through their per-device role.

# Requesting audio needs owner or admin — it switches a microphone on inside a
# hive. Listening to and deleting what is already there follows the usual roles.
