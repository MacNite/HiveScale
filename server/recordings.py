"""On-request audio from a hive's HiveInside node.

A HiveInside 0.6.0 node can be asked for live audio: an authenticated request
makes it capture 16 kHz PCM16 and push it out over BLE, and the HiveHub relays
that stream here. This module owns the recording's whole life:

    request  -> a queued device command + a `requested` row
    stream   -> the hub POSTs a chunked body that is written to disk as it lands
    finalize -> the hub reports byte count, CRC and quality counters
    play     -> the browser reads it live (raw PCM slices) or later (a WAV file)

Two decisions shape everything here.

**Raw PCM on disk, WAV on the way out.** The file is exactly what the node sent:
16 kHz, 16-bit little-endian, mono. A `.wav` download is that file behind a
44-byte header generated per request. Storing WAV instead would mean either
rewriting the header every time the file grows (it grows while a live session is
in flight) or storing the audio twice.

**A live session is readable before it is finished.** The dashboard polls
`/pcm?offset=` for whatever has landed so far and plays it through the Web Audio
API. That is why the upload writes and flushes incrementally rather than
buffering: a recording still being written is a normal, useful thing to read.

Recordings are kept until somebody deletes them — no retention sweep. See
docs/audio-recording.md.
