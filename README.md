# HiveHub

> **Project renamed: HiveScale → HiveHub.** The project outgrew its original
> "dual scale" scope and now acts as a **data collector / hub for many different
> types of beehive sensors and scales** (up to 16 hives per ESP32), so the name
> was changed to match. A few internal identifiers — the database measurement
> columns, the OTA `target` value, the Docker image name (`…/hivescale-api`), the
> device's stored-config (NVS) namespace and MQTT topics — still use the old
> `hivescale` name on purpose: changing them would need data/firmware migrations
> and could strand existing measurements or deployed-device config. The
> third-party **beehivemonitoring.com "HiveScale"** wireless weight scale is an
> unrelated product and keeps its own name.

**Hardware status: all published PCBs are tested and working.** The recommended build is the **XIAO ESP32-C6 on the Scale Module V0.4** with **NAU7802**, **MAX17048**, **TPS63020**, **TP4056**, RTC, SD card and SHT40 — optionally expanded to **16 scales** with the NAU7802 breakout PCB (TCA9548A mux + up to 8× NAU7802). See [pcb-design/README.md](pcb-design/README.md). The old ESP32 30-pin board is obsolete and no longer recommended.

**HiveHub is an ESP32-based data collector for beehive sensors and scales.** It
gathers weight, temperature, humidity, sound, vibration, power state, and network
state from one or more hives (up to 16 per ESP32) and sends the readings to a
self-hosted FastAPI backend backed by PostgreSQL, where they can be displayed in
[HivePal](https://github.com/martinhrvn/hive-pal).

### Natively supported sensors

Every sensor is optional and compiled in per device — HiveHub reads the
following directly on the ESP32:

- **Ambient sensor (SHT4x / SHT3x / BME280)** — one device-level outside-hive
  sensor on the shared I2C bus, selectable at build time: SHT4x/SHT40 (default)
  or SHT3x for temperature + humidity, or a BME280 which additionally reports
  barometric pressure (`ambient_pressure_hpa`).
- **DS18B20** — per-hive in-hive temperature probes (1-Wire).
- **INMP441** — in-hive sound via I2S MEMS microphones with per-band FFT.
- **MAX17048** — LiPo battery voltage, state-of-charge, and low-battery alerts (I2C).
- **Wired load cells via HX711 or NAU7802** — the hive scales themselves; NAU7802
  over I2C (optionally behind a TCA9548A mux) scales to many channels for
  multi-hive setups.

On top of these wired sensors, HiveHub also bridges a range of wireless BLE/GATT
sensors and scales (HolyIot, RuuviTag, HiveInside, and beehivemonitoring.com
HiveHeart / HiveScale devices) — see [Features](#features) below.

## Features

Every sensor is optional and compiled in per device — start with weight and add the rest.

- **Dual load cells** — two HX711 amplifiers drive two independent hive scales (the one always-on measurement).
- **Backend load-cell temperature compensation** — corrects HX711 thermal drift on read from the stored raw values; see [docs/temperature-compensation.md](docs/temperature-compensation.md).
- **Per-hive temperature** — optional DS18B20 probes on a shared 1-Wire bus (off by default), or an in-hive BLE sensor as the source.
- **Per-hive in-hive sound** — optional INMP441 stereo I2S microphones with per-band FFT (off by default).
- **Per-hive vibration** — from a paired in-hive BLE sensor (a HiveInside nRF54LM20A gives full FFT bands; a HolyIot/RuuviTag beacon gives a low-rate magnitude), capturing the ~20 Hz pre-swarm signal microphones miss. (The old wired LIS3DH/LIS2DH12 driver has been removed — in-hive vibration is BLE-only.)
- **In-hive BLE sensors** — pair up to two battery beacons (HolyIot 25015, RuuviTag, HiveInside nRF54LM20A, or beehivemonitoring.com HiveHeart) for temperature/humidity/pressure/vibration with no wiring. Note that a HiveHeart is read over GATT and accepts only **one** connection at a time, so HiveHub, the beehivemonitoring Hub and the beehivemonitoring app cannot share one — see [beehivemonitoring-gatt.md](docs/beehivemonitoring-gatt.md#one-reader-at-a-time).
- **Ambient temperature & humidity** — one selectable device-level I2C sensor: SHT4x/SHT40 (default), SHT3x, or a BME280 that also reports barometric pressure (`ambient_pressure_hpa`). Picked at build time (`ENABLE_SHT4X_AMBIENT` / `ENABLE_SHT3X_AMBIENT` / `ENABLE_BME280_AMBIENT`).
- **RTC timekeeping** — a DS3231 timestamps measurements without depending on NTP.
- **SD card cache & backup** — local buffering when uploads fail, plus an append-only persistent backup that can be downloaded in AP mode and re-imported via HivePal.
- **Claim-code pairing** — claim devices from HivePal without manual database setup.
- **Remote configuration & commands** — sampling interval, scale offsets/factors, calibration, OTA checks, provisioning, reboot, Wi-Fi reset, and factory reset.
- **OTA firmware updates** — owner-scoped releases with an accept-to-apply gate; the device also relays firmware over BLE GATT to a HiveInside sensor or a HiveTraffic counter. Both relays are version-gated and explicit: publishing a release never pushes it to a sub-device on its own.
- **Wi-Fi provisioning portal** — opened by the setup button (or remotely with a `start_provisioning` command) for field configuration, including pairing wireless sensors.
- **[Inspection mode](docs/inspection-mode.md)** — one press of the external button, a dashboard switch or a HivePal API call marks the window while a hive is open, so the 40 kg step from lifting two supers stays out of the charts, insights and alert rules. Nothing is deleted: the readings remain in the database and in every export.
- **Multi-network Wi-Fi** — up to three saved networks.
- **Insights** — backend auto-evaluation of weight, temperature, sound, vibration, and entrance traffic per hive, based on [these publications](docs/insights-sources-tldr.md).
- **Insight alert notifications (optional)** — get swarm / robbing / winter-risk alerts by **e-mail (SMTP)** and/or **Web Push** to your phone or an installable dashboard PWA (Android, iOS 16.4+, desktop) when an insight first fires or escalates. Off by default; see [Insight alert notifications](docs/notifications.md).
- **Optional off-grid mode** — solar/LiPo charging (CN3791 MPPT + TPS63020) with MAX17048 LiPo telemetry.
- **Optional entrance bee counters** — wireless [HiveTraffic](docs/hivetraffic-bee-counter.md) counters over **BLE/GATT only** (wired I2C BeeCounters are no longer supported).
- **Built-in web dashboard (optional)** — a dependency-free dashboard served from the backend at `/dashboard` for single-owner self-hosts, protected by **username + password login** (first visit runs a setup wizard; admin/viewer roles): cross-device hive comparison, charts for every data group, plus device-config editing, hive renaming, firmware/OTA and calibration controls, SD-backup import, and user management. Off by default (`ENABLE_LOCAL_DASHBOARD`); see [server/dashboard/README.md](server/dashboard/README.md) and the [live demo](https://macnite.github.io/HiveHub/dashboard-demo/).
- **Publish data for your website** — from **Device & admin → Publish data**, publish one chart (a metric, the hives you pick, a rolling period) and embed it in a club page, blog or shop with a one-line `<iframe>` — or fetch the same slice as JSON/CSV and draw it yourself. Everything else stays behind the login: a published link exposes only the labels you typed, no device IDs or other readings, and can be revoked at any time. See [Publish data](docs/publish-embed.md).
- **[HivePal](https://github.com/martinhrvn/hive-pal) integration** — dedicated `/api/v1/app/...` endpoints using a HivePal service key, per-user JWTs, and per-user access roles.
- **Optional MQTT bridge** — mirror every reading to an MQTT broker (Home Assistant, Node-RED, openHAB…) with Home Assistant auto-discovery, alongside the built-in PostgreSQL store. Off by default; see [MQTT / Home Assistant integration](#mqtt--home-assistant-integration).
- **PCB designs (tested and working)** — KiCad ESP32-C6 Scale Module (recommended) and NAU7802 breakout board with fabrication outputs, plus the Power Module and legacy 30-pin Scale Module.
- **Docker Compose deployment** — the API and PostgreSQL database.

### Optional bee counters

Entrance traffic counting (in/out bees) is **BLE/GATT-only**:

- **HiveTraffic** — the wireless [2026-easy-bee-counter](https://github.com/MacNite/2026-easy-bee-counter) board; see [docs/hivetraffic-bee-counter.md](docs/hivetraffic-bee-counter.md). Pairable to any hive.
- Wired I2C BeeCounters (the old `0x30`/`0x31` slave path, including firmware updates over I2C) are **no longer supported**. BeeCounter firmware is updated over BLE GATT instead — see [hivetraffic-bee-counter.md](docs/hivetraffic-bee-counter.md).

### Firmware pin mapping

Pins are defined in `firmware/include/config.h` (with optional per-device overrides in `secrets.h`). The firmware source is split into focused units under `firmware/src/` (`main.cpp`, `hivehub_network.cpp`, `portal.cpp`, `sensors.cpp`, `scale_bus.cpp`, `i2c_bus.cpp`, `hive_config.cpp`, `mics.cpp`, `ble_sensor.cpp`, `beehive_gatt.cpp`, `bee_counter_client.cpp`, `storage_power.cpp`, `device_prefs.cpp`, `status_led.cpp`, `globals.cpp`).

The table below is the **legacy 30-pin ESP32** map. The recommended **XIAO ESP32-C6** build (`pio run -e xiao_esp32c6`) has its own pin map — NAU7802 scales over I2C on D4/D5, DS18B20 on D1, SD on D3/D8–D10, button on D2, no HX711/INMP441 — see [docs/wiring.md](docs/wiring.md) and [pcb-design/README.md](pcb-design/README.md).

| Signal | GPIO | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| HX711 #1 DOUT / SCK | 16 / 17 | Scale 1; SCK held high during deep sleep to power down the HX711 |
| HX711 #2 DOUT / SCK | 32 / 33 | Scale 2; SCK held high during deep sleep to power down the HX711 |
| DS18B20 1-Wire data | 4 | Shared bus for both probes; 4.7 kΩ pull-up to 3.3 V (`ENABLE_DS18B20_HIVE_TEMP`) |
| I2C SDA / SCL | 21 / 22 | RTC, SHT4x, NAU7802/TCA9548A, optional MAX17048 — shared bus at an explicit **100 kHz** |
| SD CS / SCK / MISO / MOSI | 5 / 18 / 23 / 19 | MicroSD over SPI |
| Setup button | 27 | `INPUT_PULLUP`; short press opens provisioning AP, long press factory resets |

> On the **XIAO ESP32-C6** (firmware 0.25.0+) the setup button is the board's on-board USER/BOOT button, and the external D2 button is the [inspection button](docs/inspection-mode.md). The 30-pin board above is unchanged. Note that GPIO9 cannot wake the C6 from deep sleep and holding it at power-up enters the serial bootloader, so on that board press and hold the USER button and the AP opens a second into the next wake (up to one send interval away) — or press RESET, release it, *then* hold BOOT to get there in under a minute (never hold BOOT across the RESET: that is the flashing gesture). For a sealed hub use **Start AP mode** in the dashboard — see [docs/ap-mode-sd-download.md](docs/ap-mode-sd-download.md).
| INMP441 BCLK / WS / SD | 14 / 13 / 34 | I2S, shared by both mics; GPIO34 is input-only (`ENABLE_INMP441_MICS`) |

> See [docs/wiring.md](docs/wiring.md) for detailed wiring and [pcb-design/README.md](pcb-design/README.md) for the KiCad breakout PCB pinout.

## Firmware setup

### Prerequisites

- PlatformIO (VS Code extension or CLI).

### Configuration

```bash
cp firmware/include/secrets.example.h firmware/include/secrets.h
```

Edit `firmware/include/secrets.h`:

```cpp
#define DEVICE_ID           "hive-001"
#define API_KEY             "your-api-key-here"   // unique per device — see note below
#define CLAIM_CODE          "ABCD-1234"
#define CLAIM_CODE_REVISION 1
#define API_BASE_URL        "https://your-backend-domain.com"   // HTTPS (TLS is verified)

#define WIFI1_SSID          "your-wifi-ssid-1"
#define WIFI1_PASS          "your-wifi-password-1"
// WIFI2_* and WIFI3_* are optional fallbacks
```

Values in `secrets.h` seed the device's persistent `Preferences` on first boot. Later changes are usually made through the backend or provisioning portal. Set `FORCE_RESEED true` only when you intentionally want to overwrite stored preferences from the build file.

> **Per-device API key:** give each device its own unique `API_KEY` (generate one
> with `openssl rand -hex 32`). The backend registers the key against the device's
> `device_id` on first contact and rejects mismatches afterwards, so a leaked key
> only affects that one device. It no longer has to match the server's `API_KEY`
> environment variable — that value is now only the master/admin key for tooling.

### TLS / certificate verification

The firmware verifies the backend's TLS certificate. It ships the ISRG Root X1
(Let's Encrypt) root CA in `firmware/include/ca_cert.h` and syncs the clock over
NTP after connecting so validity can be checked. Therefore:

- By default, the backend must be reachable over **HTTPS with a valid certificate** (a reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt is the simplest setup).
- For a CA other than Let's Encrypt, replace the certificate in `firmware/include/ca_cert.h` (instructions are in that file).
- NTP (UDP port 123) must be reachable from the device's network.

For a trusted LAN deployment that cannot use TLS, add the following **firmware
build setting** to `secrets.h` and use an `http://` `API_BASE_URL` (for example,
`http://192.168.1.10:31115`). This is intentionally not a server environment
variable: the ESP32 selects its transport before it can contact the server.

```cpp
#define ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP 1
```

The opt-in keeps HTTPS working and certificate-verified, but also permits HTTP
for API requests and OTA downloads. HTTP exposes the per-device API key,
measurements, commands, and firmware image to anyone able to observe or alter
traffic, so use it only on an isolated, trusted network.

### Optional modules

Optional sensors are enabled per build in `secrets.h`. The defaults shipped in `secrets.example.h`:

```cpp
#define ENABLE_DS18B20_HIVE_TEMP 0   // wired in-hive temperature probes (default off)
#define ENABLE_INMP441_MICS      0   // stereo I2S mics + per-band FFT (default off)
#define ENABLE_BLE_SCAN          1   // in-hive BLE sensor bridge — HolyIot/RuuviTag/HiveInside (default on)
#define ENABLE_BEEHIVE_GATT      0   // beehivemonitoring.com HiveHeart / HiveScale over GATT (default off)
#define ENABLE_MAX17048_BATTERY  0   // LiPo fuel-gauge telemetry (default off)
```

The [secrets.h configurator](website/configurator.html) writes these (and the wireless-sensor macros) for you.

> Cellular (SIM7080G) transport is no longer part of this firmware. LTE, solar,
> and battery handling now live on a separate **Power Module** that connects to
> the Scale Module over I2C/ESP-NOW. The ESP32 firmware itself is Wi-Fi only.

### Download a prebuilt image (no toolchain)

Every CI run builds both targets and attaches the images to the run, and every
tagged release carries them permanently:

| Where | What you get | Keeps |
|---|---|---|
| [Releases](../../releases) | Images for the tagged version | forever |
| [Actions → CI](../../actions/workflows/ci.yml) → a run → *Artifacts* | Images for that exact commit, incl. branches and PRs | 90 days |

Two files per board — `esp32-c6` (XIAO, recommended) and `esp32` (legacy 30-pin):

- **`hivehub_<board>_<version>_full.bin`** — bootloader + partition table +
  otadata + application, written as a single file at offset `0x0`. Use this for
  a blank board.
- **`hivehub_<board>_<version>.bin`** — application image only. This is the file
  to upload to your backend for OTA, or to the dashboard's firmware uploader.

```bash
# XIAO ESP32-C6, blank board
esptool.py --chip esp32c6 --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash 0x0 hivehub_esp32-c6_0.24.7_full.bin

# Legacy 30-pin ESP32
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 hivehub_esp32_0.24.7_full.bin
```

Prebuilt images contain no `secrets.h`: Wi-Fi, server URL and API key are set on
the device through the [setup portal](#wi-fi-provisioning-portal), and the
compile-time feature flags stay at their defaults. To change a flag (DS18B20,
INMP441 mics, GATT sensors …) you still need a local build.

`firmware/ci/package_build.sh <env>` produces the same files locally after a
`pio run`.

### Flash from source

```bash
cd firmware
pio run --target upload
pio device monitor   # 115200 baud
```

### PlatformIO dependencies

`platformio.ini` installs the required libraries automatically:

- `bogde/HX711`, `paulstoffregen/OneWire`, `milesburton/DallasTemperature`
- `adafruit/Adafruit SHT4x Library`, `adafruit/RTClib`, `bblanchon/ArduinoJson`
- `kosme/arduinoFFT` — per-band FFT for the INMP441 mics and the vibration bands
- `h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino` (2.x) — the in-hive BLE sensor bridge and GATT clients

Optional libraries:

- `sparkfun/SparkFun MAX1704x Fuel Gauge Arduino Library` — `ENABLE_MAX17048_BATTERY`

---

## Wi-Fi provisioning portal

Press the setup button (the on-board USER button on the XIAO ESP32-C6, GPIO27 on the legacy 30-pin board) to manage field configuration without reflashing. A hub already sealed in an enclosure can open the same portal remotely with a `start_provisioning` command from the dashboard or API.

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Short press | Starts `HiveHub-Setup-XXXX` AP; open `http://192.168.4.1` |
| Long press, 10 seconds | Clears stored Preferences and reboots |

The portal is organised **by hive**: it edits Wi-Fi networks, backend URL, device ID, claim code and API settings, and manages the hive registry — add a hive, pick its scale source (auto-detected NAU7802 channels or a wireless HiveScale) and one in-hive sensor (a DS18B20 probe by ROM or a BLE/GATT sensor by MAC, with a built-in **BLE scan**). It also offers live **scale calibration** (tare + known weight, fully offline) and an **SD-card download** (TAR) of the on-device backup. It closes automatically after 10 minutes. See [docs/multi-hive.md](docs/multi-hive.md) and [docs/ap-mode-sd-download.md](docs/ap-mode-sd-download.md).

---

## Server setup

### Docker Compose

```bash
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
# edit API_KEY, HIVEPAL_SERVICE_API_KEY, HIVEPAL_JWT_SECRET, POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
# PUBLIC_BASE_URL, and the database volume path in docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The API listens on port `31115` by default. `API_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
are **required** — compose refuses to start without them rather than falling
back to insecure defaults. Uploaded OTA firmware binaries persist in the
`firmware-data` volume.

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| API image | `ghcr.io/macnite/hivehub:latest` |
| API port | `31115` |
| Database image | `postgres:16-alpine` |
| Database name/user | `hivescale` |

See [docs/docker-install.md](docs/docker-install.md) and [docs/truenas-install.md](docs/truenas-install.md) for full guides.

### Manual / local

```bash
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://hivescale:password@localhost:5432/hivescale" \
API_KEY="your-master-admin-key" \
HIVEPAL_SERVICE_API_KEY="your-hivepal-service-key" \

| `ENABLE_PUBLIC_EMBEDS` | Optional | Allow the dashboard's **Device & admin → Publish data** panel to serve individual published charts without a login, for embedding in a website (default on; nothing is public until an admin publishes it, and the panel is hidden when this is off). See [Publish data](docs/publish-embed.md). |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | Optional | Trust `CF-Connecting-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For` for rate-limit client IPs (default `false`; set `true` only behind a reverse proxy that overwrites these headers, otherwise a direct client can spoof them to dodge the limiter) |
| `INSIGHTS_RECONCILE_*` | Optional | Background insight-history reconciliation (see `server/.env.example`) |
| `SMTP_*` / `NOTIFY_MIN_SEVERITY` | Optional | E-mail channel for insight alert notifications (off by default — see [Insight alert notifications](docs/notifications.md)) |
| `WEB_PUSH_ENABLED` / `VAPID_*` | Optional | Web Push channel for insight alert notifications (off by default — see [Insight alert notifications](docs/notifications.md)) |
| `MQTT_*` | Optional | MQTT bridge to Home Assistant / Node-RED / openHAB (off by default — see [MQTT / Home Assistant integration](#mqtt--home-assistant-integration)) |
| `TZ` | Optional | Server timezone, for example `Europe/Berlin` |

The backend auto-creates tables and runs idempotent `ALTER TABLE` statements on startup; the SQL files in `server/migrations/` can also be applied manually.

---

## MQTT / Home Assistant integration

The backend can **optionally** mirror every measurement to an MQTT broker in
addition to storing it in PostgreSQL — so HiveHub data flows into
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), Node-RED, openHAB or any MQTT
consumer. It is **off by default** and purely additive: the bridge runs in a
background thread and is fail-soft, so a broker outage never affects ingestion
or the API.

Enable it by setting `MQTT_ENABLED=true` and pointing `MQTT_HOST` at your broker
(see `server/.env.example` / `docker/.env.example` for the full list):

```bash
MQTT_ENABLED=true
MQTT_HOST=192.168.1.10        # your broker (e.g. the Mosquitto add-on)
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME=hivescale       # optional
MQTT_PASSWORD=...             # optional
MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY=true        # auto-create Home Assistant entities
```

### Topics

With `MQTT_BASE_TOPIC=hivescale` (the default):

| Topic | Payload |
|---|---|
| `hivescale/bridge/availability` | `online` / `offline` (bridge last-will) |
| `hivescale/<device_id>/availability` | `online` / `offline` (per device) |
| `hivescale/<device_id>/state` | Retained JSON of the latest reading (every non-null measurement field) |

### Home Assistant

When `MQTT_HA_DISCOVERY=true`, the bridge publishes
[MQTT-discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery)
configs the first time it sees each device. Home Assistant then automatically
creates one device per scale with a curated set of sensors — scale weights,
hive/ambient temperature & humidity, battery voltage/charge, solar power, Wi-Fi
signal, and bee-counter totals. Any in-hive wireless modules (a
beehivemonitoring.com HiveHeart/HiveScale or a HolyIOT BLE sensor) are exposed
as their own Home Assistant devices, nested under the hub, each carrying its own
full telemetry — temperature, humidity, battery and link signal (plus weight and
pressure for the scale, and sound frequency/energy/peak for the HiveHeart). Those
per-device temperature/humidity entities are published even though the hive's
resolved temperature/humidity also appear on the hub device, so a hive fitted
with several modules surfaces each one's readings separately. All other fields
remain available in the raw `state` JSON for custom templated sensors. Just make sure the
[MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) is set up
and pointed at the same broker.

See [docs/mqtt.md](docs/mqtt.md) for the full topic layout, every configuration
variable, and the per-hive / per-module Home Assistant discovery details.

### Local dashboard endpoints (optional, login-protected)

Enabled only when `ENABLE_LOCAL_DASHBOARD=true`; every route returns `404` when
disabled. Access is gated by **username + password login** (HttpOnly session
cookie): the first visit runs a setup wizard that creates the initial admin
account, read endpoints need any valid session, and write/control endpoints
need the `admin` role. The API is **not scoped per user** — one login covers
every device on the server — so keep it off on multi-tenant deployments. These
endpoints power the built-in `/dashboard` UI; see
[server/dashboard/README.md](server/dashboard/README.md).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`/`POST` | `/api/v1/local/auth/status` · `/setup` · `/login` · `/logout` | Session status / first-run wizard / sign in / sign out |

| `POST` | `/api/v1/local/devices/{id}/calibration/start` · `/stop` | Start / stop calibration mode (admin) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/local/devices/{id}/temp-compensation/fit` | Fit a load-cell temperature coefficient (admin) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/local/notifications/config` | Which alert channels are enabled + VAPID public key |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/local/notifications/subscribe` · `/unsubscribe` | Register / forget this browser's Web Push subscription |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/local/notifications/test` | Send a test alert over every enabled channel |

### Public embed endpoints (no login)

The only routes on the server that need no credentials. Each serves exactly one
chart an admin published through **Publish data** above, addressed by an
unguessable token, and nothing else — no device IDs, no other readings, no
access to any other endpoint. They 404 when `ENABLE_PUBLIC_EMBEDS=false`, when
the publication is taken offline, and when it is revoked. See
[docs/publish-embed.md](docs/publish-embed.md).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/embed/chart/{token}` | Self-contained page for `<iframe>` embedding in a website |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/public/charts/{token}` | The published chart as JSON (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/public/charts/{token}.csv` | The same points as CSV |

## Measurement payload highlights

Core fields include weights, hive/ambient temperatures and humidity, raw HX711 values, firmware/config version, sensor status, boot count, and time source. Builds with optional hardware can also send:

- **Acoustic (INMP441):** `mic_ok`, per-channel `mic_left_*` / `mic_right_*` RMS/peak levels and per-band FFT energy (`*_band_sub_bass_dbfs`, `*_band_hum_dbfs`, `*_band_piping_dbfs`, `*_band_stress_dbfs`, `*_band_high_dbfs`).
- **In-hive BLE sensor:** `hive_N_humidity_percent`, `ble_N_humidity_percent`, `ble_N_pressure_hpa`, and the beehivemonitoring.com `hiveheart_N_*` / `hivescale_N_*` fields.
- **Vibration:** `accel_N_ok`, broadband `accel_N_rms_mg` / `accel_N_peak_mg`, and per-band energy `accel_N_band_swarm_mg` (8–30 Hz) / `_fanning_mg` (30–100 Hz) / `_activity_mg` (100–200 Hz) — populated by the in-hive BLE sensor.
- **Entrance traffic (HiveTraffic BeeCounter, BLE/GATT):** `bee_counter_1_*` / `bee_counter_2_*` lifetime totals, gate health, and status fields; the backend derives the interval in/out counts by differencing consecutive totals.
- **Power telemetry:** `battery_*` (MAX17048) fields; the backend also still accepts the legacy `solar_*` fields.
- **Status:** `network_transport`, `calibration_mode`, `boot_count`, `time_source`.

The backend accepts `network_transport` for the future Power Module; on-device firmware reports `network_transport: "wifi"`. (The old `cellular_ok` / `cellular_csq` fields were removed from the schema and are silently ignored if sent.) Fields are stored in dedicated PostgreSQL columns (plus `raw_json`) and returned through the latest-measurements and HivePal app APIs.

---

## Claim-code pairing

1. Set `CLAIM_CODE` in `secrets.h` before flashing, for example `ABCD-1234`.
2. The firmware includes the claim code in every measurement until the **server confirms the device is claimed** (the upload response carries `"claimed": true`), then stops sending it to limit exposure. Confirming rather than assuming matters: a rebuilt or restored backend has no record of the device, and a device that stopped sending its code could never be claimed again.
3. The backend stores a hash of the claim code and creates an unclaimed device record on the first measurement.
4. HivePal (or another app client) calls `POST /api/v1/app/devices/claim` with the code.
5. The matched device is assigned to the user as `owner`.

### Un-pairing and re-pairing

The pairing is fully reversible, from either end:

- **Removing the device in the app** deletes your membership, and releases the device when you were the last member — `claimed_at` is cleared so the same claim code pairs it again. An owner can release a *shared* device in one step with `DELETE /api/v1/app/devices/{id}/claim` instead of waiting for every member to remove themselves.
- **The device notices** on its next upload (firmware 0.24.9+): the server answers `"claimed": false`, the firmware drops its local "claim registered" latch, and the claim code starts flowing again automatically. No reflash, no factory reset.
- **Re-submitting the claim code in the setup portal** also clears that latch (0.24.9+), which is how a device that latched under older firmware is brought back without a factory reset.
- **Older firmware** (≤ 0.24.8) never clears the latch by itself, so a device that already stopped sending its claim code needs one of: the portal route above after an OTA to 0.24.9+, a `CLAIM_CODE_REVISION` bump plus re-flash, or a factory reset.
- **Readings survive** an un-pair, so re-claiming restores the history. To erase a device for good, use the local dashboard's **Delete device** (admin + claim code + typed device ID).

Databases that predate this behaviour may hold devices left claimed with no members — claimed by nobody, visible to nobody, and un-claimable. Run [`server/migrations/022_release_orphaned_devices.sql`](server/migrations/022_release_orphaned_devices.sql) once to release them; it only touches devices with zero members and changes no readings.

To push a new claim code through OTA, change `CLAIM_CODE`, increment `CLAIM_CODE_REVISION`, and publish a new firmware build.

## Remote commands

Commands are queued by the server and picked up by the device on its next cycle.

| Command type | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `calibrate_scale_1` / `calibrate_scale_2` | `{"known_weight_kg": 10.0}` | Calibrate a scale with a known weight |
| `start_calibration_mode` | `{"interval_seconds": 5, "timeout_seconds": 600}` | Temporarily use fast measurement cycles |
| `stop_calibration_mode` | `{}` | Return to normal interval and deep sleep |
| `reboot` | `{}` | Restart the ESP32 |
| `check_ota` / `ota_update` | `{}` | Trigger an immediate OTA check |
| `update_hiveinside` | `{"slot": 1, "url": "...", "version": "...", "crc32": 123}` | Relay firmware to a HiveInside sensor over BLE GATT (usually via the `update-hiveinside` helper) |
| `update_beecounter` | `{"slot": 1, "url": "...", "version": "...", "crc32": 123}` | Relay firmware to a HiveTraffic counter over BLE GATT (usually via the `update-beecounter` helper). The counter stops counting for the transfer |
| `start_provisioning` | `{}` | Start the Wi-Fi provisioning AP |

## PCB design

The `pcb-design/` directory contains the KiCad designs — **all published boards are tested and working**:

- **ESP32-C6 Scale Module (V0.4, recommended)** — the central board. Off-the-shelf modules on pin headers (no SMD soldering): XIAO ESP32-C6, NAU7802 for 2 scales, DS3231 RTC, SHT40, SD module, DS18B20 bus, MAX17048 battery gauge, TP4056 USB-C charger, and TPS63020 buck-boost regulator with a power-source selection jumper.
- **NAU7802 breakout PCB (v0.2)** — I2C frontend for up to 16 wired scales (TCA9548A mux + up to 8× NAU7802; when it is used, no NAU7802 goes on the Scale Module); optionally carries its own XIAO MCU as a standalone BLE scale sensor.
- **Power Module (V0.3)** — off-grid power (solar, battery) for a Scale Module; probably discontinued soon.
- **ESP32 30-pin Scale Module (V0.3)** — the legacy board (ESP32 DevKit + 2× HX711 + INMP441 mics); obsolete and no longer recommended.

Start with [pcb-design/README.md](pcb-design/README.md) for the recommended setup, connector pinouts, fabrication files, and assembly notes.

## Testing and quality checks

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds both firmware targets, runs the host-level
I2C-hardening and BLE-decoder tests, the Python server suite, and syntax-checks
every website/dashboard script. To run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Server / insights suite (no database needed)
pip install -r server/requirements.txt pytest
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://unused/unused PYTHONPATH=server python3 test-data/test_counter_rules.py
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://unused/unused PYTHONPATH=server python3 test-data/test_accel_rules.py

# Claim / release lifecycle (needs a real PostgreSQL — it builds the schema and
# calls the endpoints for real). Skips with a message when the DB is unreachable;
# pass --require-db to make that a failure instead, as CI does.

`curl` examples for exercising a running backend are in
[docs/test-commands.md](docs/test-commands.md); a mock server with sample data
lives in [test-data/mock-server/](test-data/mock-server/).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Device shows no data** — check `docker compose logs hivescale-api` for
  ingest errors; verify the device's `API_BASE_URL` is HTTPS with a valid
  certificate (the firmware verifies TLS) and NTP (UDP 123) is reachable.
- **OTA never triggers** — updates need three things: the release's `board`
  must match the device (`esp32` vs `esp32-c6`), the version must be newer, and
  the owner must have **approved** it (accept-to-apply gate). Also make sure
  `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set, otherwise download URLs are relative.
- **Firmware downloads 404 after a container rebuild** — uploaded binaries live
  in `FIRMWARE_DIR`; make sure the `firmware-data` volume (or a bind mount) is
  attached.
- **Dashboard says "Local dashboard is disabled"** — set
  `ENABLE_LOCAL_DASHBOARD=true` on the API container.
- **Locked out of the dashboard** — accounts live in the `dashboard_users`
  table; deleting all rows re-runs the first-visit setup wizard.
